# Simulation and Concurrency

A Simulation and Concurrency project for my MEng in University of Hull.
The project is written in C++ with DirectX, DirectX toolkit, Winsock2 and C++11 thrading.
The aim of this project is to create a distributed, physically-based modelling demonstrator for a seris of gravity wells.


Current stage of the sofware:
<br>-physics modelling
<br>-handle rendering, physics modelling and network on different core
<br>--network connection for sharing user input and physics information
<br>--distributing different objects modelling on different machines
<br>--handle 20% package lost
